# InfixToPostfix

Infix expressions are what humans use to solve normally by considering the precedence of the operators but computers use stack to solve expressions.
And without taking care of operatorâ€™s precedence prefix and postfix expressions are used to solved by systems.

# What does this code do ?

1.Checks whether expression is well parenthesized or not.

2.Converts infix expression to postfix

3.Evaluates the postfix expression to get the result(can handle any number of digits).
